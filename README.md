Chef AI generates unique recipes for you from what is in your fridge. A user can add items to their digital fridge that then get stored in a SQLite Database. The user can add ingredients with an optional expiration date. When they press get cooking and select a meal type an API request is made to the Gemini API. It generates unique recipes that also prioritise items that were brought a while ago as well as close to the expiration date helping to reduce food waste.
