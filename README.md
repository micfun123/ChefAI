## ChefAI

ChefAI is a Flutter application developed for the Google Gemini API Developer Competition. This innovative project leverages the capabilities of the Gemini API to enhance culinary experiences through AI-powered features. A user can add items to their digital fridge that then get stored in a SQLite Database. The user can add ingredients with an optional expiration date. When they press get cooking and select a meal type an API request is made to the Gemini API. It generates unique recipes that also prioritise items that were brought a while ago as well as close to the expiration date helping to reduce food waste.

## Features

-   AI-powered recipe generation
-   Ingredient substitution suggestions
-   Nutritional analysis of recipes
-   Personalized meal planning
